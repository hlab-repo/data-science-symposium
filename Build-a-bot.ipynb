It is a fully functional bot, built in the programming language of Python, that uses Markov processes to autogenerate its own verses based on the King James Version Bible. This is a slightly simplified version of the program behind [KJVBot](https://twitter.com/kjvbot), which tweets its auto-generated verses based on all or part of the KJV Bible.\n","<br>\n","<br>\n","This program can easily be adapted to work from other texts (just upload a different .txt file and feed it start phrases that you know are in that text). No coding experience is necessary here, but each step is annotated for those who want to understand more about what's going on from line to line.\n","<br>\n","<br>\n","As with all programs in Colab, you can either run each cell of code one at a time by clicking each play button, or you can run them all in order by selecting \"Runtime\" / \"Run all\" from the menu at the top.\n","\n","##**About Markov Processes**\n","\n","The Markov process is a simple yet powerful means of prediction. It begins with a *current state* and, based on probability, predicts what the *next state* to follow that state will be. So, for example, if we were talking about predicting the weather, and the *current state* were raining, the Markov process would make a list of all the states in its data that have come after raining (partly cloudy, sunny, sunny, raining, raining, raining, partly cloudy). Then it would randomly choose from that list, and whatever it chooses would become the new *current state*. Given that certain next states are more common in the list than others (e.g., continuing rain), its prediction is probablistic. Now, imagine that our database is not weather history but *The Washington Post*, and that our *current state* is the word \"Barack.\" The Markov process would go through the entire database of news text (very quickly!), make a list of every *next state* word or punctuation mark that has followed \"Barack,\" and randomly select one from that list. Let's say 96% of the time \"Obama\" is the *next state* word after \"Barack.\" So most of the time the process will end up selecting that word as its *next state* prediciton. That word then becomes the *current state*, and the process begins again, compiling and selecting from a list of all the *next states* to \"Obama\". And so on.\n","<br>\n","<br>\n","With this bot, the process continues until it lands upon a period, exclamation mark, question mark, at which point it stops and, if the length of the utterance is less than 130 characters (or whatever you set the limit to be), it prints that utterance. If it's over the set limit, it starts again from scratch. And all that in a second or two!\n","\n","##**Before Diving In ...**\n","\n","You need to do two things.

Then, using the list_crawler() function, defined above, and the **defaultdict** module that we imported, it turns that list of tokens into a huge dictionary of key:value pairs, with each \"key\" being a three-token string and each \"value\" being the next word that follows that string in the text. What this gives us, then, is every next word, or *next state*, that comes after every three-word phrase, or *current state*, in the text. The result of this process gives us a very, very long dictionary that looks like this (with the three tokens in parentheses as the key and the bracketed token, which is the *next state* in the text, is the value for that key):\n","\n",">{('the', 'revelation', 'of'): ['jesus'], ('revelation', 'of', 'jesus'): ['christ'], ('of', 'jesus', 'christ'): [','], ('jesus', 'christ', ','): ['which'], ('christ', ',', 'which'): ['god'], (',', 'which', 'god'): ['gave'] ...}\n","\n","Once it has built that dictionary, the build_sentence() function works within an iterating loop to build the actual verse or \"utterance.\" It does so using a Markov process: beginning with a three-token start phrase as its *current state*, it makes a list of all possible *next states* (tokens that follow that phrase) in the text, and then randomly selects one from its list. That new token then becomes the third of the three tokens in the *current state* (the former first token drops off), and the process begins again. The process continues until it randomly selects a period, exclamation point, or question mark, at which point it stops. If the resulting utterance is less than 130 characters (or whatever you set the limit to be), it prints it; if not, it starts all over again with a new three-token start phrase."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"MabOs0O5gPsZ","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["def markovize(word1, word2, word3, fileid, char_limit=None):\n","    with open(fileid, encoding='utf-8') as f:\n","        text = f.read()\n","    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)\n","    sent_tokens = defaultdict(list)\n","    for sentence in sentences:\n","        tokens = re.findall(r\"[\\w']+|[׃.,?!:;\\n]\", sentence)\n","        crawled_list = list_crawler(tokens, n=4)\n","        if crawled_list:\n","            for token1, token2, token3, token4 in crawled_list:\n","                sent_tokens[token1, token2, token3].append(token4)\n","    too_long = True\n","    while too_long:\n","        sentence = [word1, word2, word3]\n","        utterance = build_sentence(sentence, sent_tokens)\n","        len_utterance = len(utterance)\n","        if char_limit is not None and len_utterance > char_limit:\n","            too_long = True\n","        else:\n","            too_long = False\n","    print(utterance)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kmzPBK2vynSE","colab_type":"text"},"source":["##**4.
